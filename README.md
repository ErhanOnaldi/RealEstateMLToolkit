# RealEstateMLToolkit

## Description

The RealEstateMLToolkit project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to address two significant aspects of real estate data analysis: house price prediction and fraud detection in property listings. By implementing various regression and classification models, this project provides a comprehensive toolset for analyzing real estate data.

## Objectives
1. **House Price Prediction**: Develop models to predict house prices based on various features such as size, number of rooms, location, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

2. **Fraud Detection**: Create models to identify fraudulent property listings. This helps in ensuring the integrity of the real estate market by flagging suspicious listings that may involve scams or false information.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- **Regression Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Multilinear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression

- **Classification Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Kernel SVM
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree Classification
  - Random Forest Classification

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gather real estate data from sources like Kaggle, including house prices and property listing information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data to prepare it for model training.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate multiple regression models for house price prediction and classification models for fraud detection. Use metrics like MSE, RMSE, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare model performance.
4. **Results and Analysis**: Present the results of the models, compare their performance, and analyze the insights derived from the predictions and detections.

## Conclusion
The RealEstateMLToolkit project provides a valuable resource for real estate data analysis, offering tools for both price estimation and fraud detection. By employing a range of machine learning models, this toolkit aims to enhance decision-making and ensure market integrity in the real estate industry.
